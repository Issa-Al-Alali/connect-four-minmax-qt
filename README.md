# Connect Four Game with AI

## Description
This project is an implementation of the classic Connect Four game in C++ using the Qt framework for the graphical user interface. It features an AI opponent that uses the Minimax algorithm to play strategically.

## Features
* Graphical User Interface built with Qt.
* Player vs AI gameplay.
* AI opponent driven by the Minimax algorithm.
* Standard Connect Four rules and win conditions.
* Visual feedback for disc drops and winning lines.

## Technologies Used
* **Programming Language:** C++
* **GUI Framework:** Qt
* **AI Algorithm:** Minimax

## Setup & Installation
1.  Create a Qt Widgets Application and copy then paste the main.cpp
2.  Ensure you have a compatible C++ compiler (like g++ or Clang) and the Qt development libraries installed.

## How to Play
1.  Launch the application.
2.  Players take turns dropping their colored discs into one of the seven columns.
3.  The disc falls to the lowest available position within the selected column.
4.  The first player to get four of their discs in a row – horizontally, vertically, or diagonally – wins the game.
5.  If the entire board is filled and no player has achieved four in a row, the game is a draw.
